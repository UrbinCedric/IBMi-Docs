# Development in VS Code

A brief introduction to developing on IBMi with VS Code.



## Syntax Highlighting
* [IBMi Languages](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=barrettotte.ibmi-languages) - my extension for IBMi languages such as RPG, RPGLE, CL, DDS, and MI.
* [RPG](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NielsLiisberg.RPG) - RPGLE syntax highlighting



## Integrated File System (IFS)
Install [SSH FS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kelvin.vscode-sshfs).
This extension allows you to attach a directory on the IFS in your VS Code workspace.



## QSYS
Unfortunately, there is no good way of handling the "library" file system.
I am working on a CLI to facilitate this functionality, but it is not public as of writing.
