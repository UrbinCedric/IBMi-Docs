# IBMi ODBC on Windows


Luckily for everyone, the brilliant Liam Barry already documented the hard part at https://github.com/worksofliam/blog/issues/25.
This is for NodeJS, but the section on "Installing the IBM i ODBC driver for Windows" is what we're looking for.

After installing the ODBC driver, verify the installation by running **odbcad32.exe**.
There should be a couple new entries, but at the very least we should have **"IBM i Access ODBC Driver"**.
