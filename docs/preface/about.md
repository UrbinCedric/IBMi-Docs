# About This Documentation


## What is this?
This documentation is an attempt to coherently organize various notes for learning IBM i. The hardest part about trying to learn IBM i is figuring out where to start.
**This is currently by no means a complete A-Z guide to IBM i**.


## Why?
The primary goal of this dcoumentation is to give enough information to feel somewhat comfortable programming and navigating IBM i.
IBM i is very intimidating to someone with a more modern programming background. Understandably, a lot of people take one look at the green screen and immediately write it off. 
I think more people would enjoy learning it if there was a better place to start. I think that IBM i will still be around for awhile and there will be a growing need for IBM i developers as time goes on.
