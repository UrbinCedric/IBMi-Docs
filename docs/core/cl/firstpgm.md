# Your First CL Program


Writing, compiling, and running your first CL program.

The program will be a simple ECHO program. It receives input and echos it back to the user.


## CL Source Physical File

To start, enter the command ```WRKOBJPDM YOURLIB```

In order to start writing CL programs, you need to make sure you have a CL source physical file (QCLLESRC).
In the previous chapter a CL source physical file was created while learning about SEU.
If you don't have it, please revisit that section.


## CL Source Member

Enter the command ```WRKMBRPDM YOURLIB/QCLLESRC```.


To create a new CL source member press **F6**
and populate the prompt as shown.


<figure align="center">
	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-01.PNG" alt="create member" />
</figure>


* The **Source member** field is the name of the source member.
* The **Source type** field is what our source member will be compiled as.
* The **Text 'description'** field does nothing to functionality.


Press **ENTER** and you are brought to SEU.


## Your First Program

At the top of each program, try to put a sentence summary of what it does.
Something like that
```php
/* Prompt for user input and echo it back as a message */
```

<br>

Next, create the CL program shell
```php
/* Prompt for user input and echo it back as a message */  
PGM                                               
                                    
ENDPGM
```

<br>

Within our program we need to store user input, so a CHAR type variable needs to be declared. 
Any length will do so I set it to 64 characters long.
```php                                                               
  DCL VAR(&in) TYPE(*CHAR) LEN(64)                                        
```

<br>

To prompt for user input, we send a message to the user with a special message type of ```*INQ``` (inquiry).
This allows us to store the message reply in our variable specified by ```MSGRPY(&in)```.
```php
SNDUSRMSG MSG('Input Something') +
    MSGTYPE(*INQ) MSGRPY(&in)      
```

<br>

and finally, we output the input back to the user as another message
```php                                 
SNDUSRMSG MSG(&in)
```

Also found at https://github.com/UrbinCedric/IBMi-Book/blob/master/QCLLESRC/ECHO.CLP

```php
/* QCLLESRC/ECHO */

/* Prompt for user input and echo it back as a message */
PGM                                 
                                    
  DCL VAR(&in) TYPE(*CHAR) LEN(64)  
                                    
  SNDUSRMSG MSG('Input Something') +
     MSGTYPE(*INQ) MSGRPY(&in)      
                                    
  SNDUSRMSG MSG(&in)                
                                    
ENDPGM                              
```

## Compile
Now that the source is entered, press **F3** to save the source member.
Now back in PDM, take an option **14** on ```ECHO``` to compile the source member to a progam object.

The compile job will be submitted to Batch and a response message will come back
saying the compilation was successful.

If the compilation failed, double check what was entered and/or scroll down to the section **Compile Errors and WRKSPLF**

</figure>


## Program Object
After compiling the source member, a program object is created.
Execute the command ```WRKOBJPDM YOURLIB``` to view all objects in your library.
As you can see, there is now an object named **ECHO** with the type of **\*PGM** and
attribute of **CLLE**. This is a totally different entity from our source member with the same name.

<figure align="center">
	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-09.PNG" alt="pgm" />
</figure>

<br>

Return back to working with members with ```WRKMBRPDM YOURLIB/QCLLESRC```


## Running
Now that the source member has been compiled to an object. It can be called.
Execute ```CALL YOURLIB/ECHO```

Ignoring the "Job ..." messages, you should see the text **Input Something**.

In the ```Reply . . .``` field, Enter some text and press **ENTER**.
Here, we are replying to a program message.

<figure align="center">
	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-03.PNG" alt="run" />
</figure>

<br>

After pressing enter, the screen pops up with the entered reply.

	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-04.PNG" alt="run" />
</figure>


## Compile Errors and WRKSPLF
Now I will show the basics of what to do when a compile job fails.
<figure align="center">
	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-05.PNG" alt="err" />
</figure>


For this example, I changed a line in ```ECHO``` to read
```php
/* &in2 does not exist! It will not compile :( */
SNDUSRMSG MSG('Input Something') +
   MSGTYPE(*INQ) MSGRPY(&in2)     
```

After receiving the message that the compile job ended abnormally,
we have to figure out why.

The ```WRKSPLF``` (Work with Spooled Files) command allows you to view
spooled files generated by jobs.
Execute the command ```WRKSPLF YOURUSER```.
<figure align="center">
	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-06.PNG" alt="wrksplf" />
</figure>

<br>

Now scroll to the bottom of the file list and you should see 2 spooled files for our last failed job.
One titled just ```ECHO``` and one title ```QPJOBLOG```.
Take an option **5** on the ```ECHO``` spooled file.
Now you have access to a bunch of information on the compile job.
<figure align="center">
	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-07.PNG" alt="wrksplf" />
</figure>

<br>

Scroll down and you will eventually stumble across an error message.
In my case, this was an error with ID ```CPD0727```.
The error messages I've seen usually seem to be pretty intuitive.

<figure align="center">
	<img src="./core/cl/_assets/cl-08.PNG" alt="wrksplf" />
</figure>

<br>

Errors definitely aren't always that easy to spot/fix, but this was just a good example
for learning the basics of compiling and the ```WRKSPLF``` command.
