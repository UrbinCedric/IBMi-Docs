# History of IBM i


This section will be an attempt to lightly describe the history of this machine without boring the reader too much.

## IBM i Ancestry

**History of Punched-Card IBM Machines**:
* 1880 **Hollerith Census Tabulator** → Only capable of counting
* 1928 **Hollerith Type IV Tabulator** → First appearance of 80-column card
* mid 1930s-1950s **IBM 400 series accounting machines**
* 1959 **IBM 1400 series** → RPG I
* 1969-1977 **IBM System/3** → RPG II, First appearance of 96-column card
* 1978 **IBM System/38** → RPG III
* 1988 **Application System/400 (AS/400)** → RPG 400/IV
* 2000 iSeries (renamed from AS/400)
* 2006 System i (renamed from iSeries)
* 2008 IBM Power Systems generation replaces IBM System i

**Report Program Generator** (RPG) was developed as a programming language used for generating reports.
RPG was first written on 80-column punchcards.
Understandably the language is columnar and looks relatively gross as a result.

As time went on and IBM i evolved, the language evolved with it. It gained various features and improvements along with
the system it ran on. The current version of RPG (RPG IV) allows for "free-format" code, breaking its ties to its columnar ancestors. 
I go into a bit more detail on RPG history in a later [section](https://barrettotte.github.io/IBMi-Book/#/core/rpgle/intro).

In this book, I will briefly go over fixed-format RPG. But, the main focus will be on either mostly free-format
with a bit of mixed format.

#### Hello World in fixed-format RPG III
```php
      C                     MOVEL'HELLO'   HELLO  11
      C                     MOVE 'WORLD'   HELLO
      C           HELLO     DSPLY          WAIT    1
      C                     SETON                     LR
```

#### Hello world in fixed-format RPG IV
```php
      C     'Hello World' DSPLY
      C                   SETON                                        LR
```

#### Hello world in free-format RPG IV
```php
       **free

       dsply ('Hello World');
	   *inlr = *on
```

<br>
As you can see, free-format RPG IV looks pretty readable. its worthwhile to be able to read fixed-format RPG III. But,
a majority of effort should be put on RPG IV free and mixed-format.


By no means is this a complete history. There's much more about IBM i that is skipped over. 
But it is sufficient to start learning this operating system.
