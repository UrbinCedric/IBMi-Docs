## IBM i
IBM i is considered a **midrange server**, its not quite a mainframe and not quite an entry-level server. 
This operating system specializes in business applications, reporting, data warehousing, and more. 
It is also well known for its minimal downtime and strong defenses; 
making it the perfect platform for companies housing financial information.

## Language Overview
There are quite a few languages native to IBM i, I will be covered
* CL
* RPG
* DB2 SQL
* DDS/DSPF (More of a data format than a language)


Additionally, more languages such as COBOL, REXX, C/C++, Python, Java, PHP, and NodeJS can be used through various means.
There are some basic information and example programs in the [Other Languages](../other/) section.


## Important Note
Some of the concepts don't start to make complete sense until you've messed around
in CL, DB2 SQL, and RPG. So if the concepts don't make sense at first, don't worry.
