# Introduction to DB2 for i

One of the most important features of IBMi is its builtin database, DB2 for i.
Its worth noting that **DB2 for i** differs slightly from other flavors of **DB2**.

When searching for snippets or documentation its important to qualify your search with something like 'IBMi'.
Its worth noting that DB2 SQL is constantly getting new system views and functions with every IBMi update.
So pay close attention to what version of OS you are using when searching around.

On this page, we will go over the basics of some of the tools included in Access Client Solutions.


## Run SQL Scripts
From the Access Client Solutions menu, click **Run SQL Scripts** under the **Database** heading.
This gives you a nice and simple SQL window to run queries.

For example, I will run a simple query to get some IBMi system tables:
```sql
select *
from QSYS2.SYSTABLES
where TABLE_SCHEMA='QSYS'
  and TABLE_OWNER='QSYS'
limit 50;
```

To run this query, you can use **CTRL + R**. This will execute the statement that your cursor is currently positioned in.<br>
Another way is to use the hourglass (sandglass) on the top to execute the statemants.

## Schemas Tool
Another tool that might be worth remembering is the Schemas tool.
From the Access Client Solutions menu, click **Schemas** under the **Database** heading.

This gives you an interface to look at various database objects.

## IBM Documentation
As always, IBM's documentation is going to be better than this documentation.
