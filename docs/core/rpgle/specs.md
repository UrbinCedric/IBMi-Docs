# RPGLE Format Specifications

Each line of an RPG program has a specification assigned to it. This specification dictates both format and meaning of the source statement. Specifications only apply to fixed-format RPGLE.

RPG IV specifications differ from RPG II and RPG III specifications.
The main differences being additional specification types and more columns to work with.

Do not waste your time memorizing these specifications, you will see why in a later section.


All specifications are optional, but must be defined in the order below.

These tables are from [The Modern RPG IV Language](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-RPG-IV-Language/dp/1583470646/ref=sr_1_3) 
and [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_72/rzasd/rpgspec.htm)



## H Specification - Header (Control)
Used to give instructions to the RPG compiler.
This includes program name, date format, debug mode, etc.

| Column | Name      | Value(s) | Description                    |
| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 6      | Form Type | H        | Mark statement as header spec  |
| 7      | Comment   | BLANK    | Process statement as normal    |
|        |           | *        | Mark statement as comment      |
| 7-80   | Functions | Keyword  | [Keywords](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_72/rzasd/cscokw.htm#cscokw) to control settings |
